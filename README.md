# Quiz_game-Dulor_Dorian-CDOF4

## How does the game works

Several questions will be randomly presented to the player.
They must answer by writing the correct response. 
If they are correct, they earn a point; otherwise, their score remains unchanged. 
In the end, all correct answers are counted, and the total is compared to the number of questions asked.

## What can be improved :
Feel free to add new questions to the "questions.py" file !
